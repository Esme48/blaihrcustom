Together We Blossom is a donor application portal that allows users to donate money in order to deliver flower bouquets to individuals who may need something to brighten their day. In this application all donations go to hospital patients, teachers, mental health survivors, senior citizens, and paramedics.

With their donor portal, donors are able to:
-Securly login & register
-Select a bouquet bundle
-Choose a donation tier
-Write a personalized message for the recipient
-Choose who will be recieivng the bouquets
-Track the status of their donation
 Note: In order for the status tracker to work correctly, another user model for an administrative user portal needs to be created. For the purposes of this project, a filtering component has been added to the controllers (controllers/component.js) in order to simulate the status of the donor order
